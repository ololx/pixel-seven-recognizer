##  üìñ About

The Pixel Seven Recognizer is a simple recognizer, which allows to draw one digit and get the answer on a question "Is this digit intended?". This recognizer based on the single layer perceptron and could be trained to recognition of one digit (from 1 to 9). The following image demonstrates this recognition.

## üì∏ Demo

This image demonstrates the recognizer usage. The green background means that the digit is intended, the red background - no.

This image  demonstrates the visualisation of the recognizer training process. Each pixel of the image is colored according to its weight for the neural network. Green means positive weight for a given pixel, red means negative weight. A more saturated color means a higher value, black means 0.

## üéö Features

- The simple funny digit recognizer, which allows to draw one digit and to get the answer on a question "Is this digit intended?". 

### To Do

- ~~For more information on an upcoming development, please read the todo list.~~ No plans.

### Changelog

- For more information on a releases, a features and a changes, please read the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) notes.

## üö¶ Getting Started

These instructions allow to get a copy of this project and run it on a local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before using it, make sure that follows software are installed on the local machine:

- **[Oracle JDK 9+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)** - the java development kit.

If any of the listed software is not installed, then it can be installed by instruction as described below.

1. #### Oracle JDK 11+

   - Install Oracle JDK 11+ according to instructions from an [official](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) instruction.

### Installing

In order to install it is quite simple to clone or download this repository, or download `jar` file from release assets.

### Cloning

For the cloning this repository to a local machine, just use the follows link:

```http
https://github.com/ololx/pixel-seven-recognizer.git
```

### Using

To use it is necessary to:
1. Build the project.
2. Launch the instance .jar with the follows args:
```bash
{digit} path_to_training_data
```
where {digit} - is a digit from 0 to 9; path_to_training_data - path to directory with a png files (the name should contains from 11 symbols, where 11s symbol is a digit; fro instance `000000-num5.png` for png with `5` ).
*For* instance:` java -jar pixel-seven-recognizer.jar 2 /Volumes/disk1/traindata`
*!Important: the data set could be downloaded by the following link https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.tar.gz* (author's repository link -  https://github.com/pjreddie/mnist-csv-png)

3. Wait until the training data is loaded and the training process is complete (after training will be a black frame).
4. Draw digit and clear it, and  again:
    4.1. Use the first mouse button to draw. 
    4.2. Use the second mouse button to clear.
    4.3. Use the mouse wheel (up/down) to resize the brush stroke.
